## 📋 What is TaskChaser?
TaskChaser is like having a friendly, super-organized project manager who never sleeps, never forgets, and always knows exactly what you need to do next.

It automatically sends **personalized daily task summaries** using AI, so you can focus on doing the work instead of remembering it.

> *“Hey Sarah! Today you have 3 tasks. Start with the client proposal (high priority) before 11 AM, then tackle the team meeting notes. Oh—and don’t forget a coffee break at 3 PM ☕”*

That’s **TaskChaser** 🤖✨
